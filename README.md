# Dotfiles and scripts that behave in much the same way that manual configurations don't.

## `scripts/`

* `symlink.sh` sets up symlinks in `$HOME`
* `aptinstall.sh` is for Ubuntu repository installs
* `programs.sh` is for other software
* `desktop.sh` is for GNOME desktop settings
* `setup.sh` runs all the scripts and `upgrade`s
